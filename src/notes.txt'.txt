NY TIME
4am
if we were bearish right before, then get a fib to long from top to bottom of the move, if the R is very low, dont take the trade

8:30 am
optimal trade entry on btc, dont take trade if its not a big move, -1.35/1.4 is a nice fib there

look for reversals / trend continuations depending on s/r levels at the time when market closes in one part of the world

exit 0.25 the position @ -1 , exit 0.5 of it at -1.35/-1.4 and exit the rest at -2, place stop for the leftover 0.25 at 0.5
